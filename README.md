# Neural Cash - AI-Powered Financial Insights

## 🚀 Overview
Neural Cash is an AI-driven fintech solution that analyzes mobile money transactions to determine financial behavior and provides personalized suggestions to improve financial health. By leveraging artificial intelligence, we aim to empower individuals with insights into their spending habits and offer recommendations for better financial decisions.

## 🎯 Problem Statement
A significant percentage of individuals, especially in cash-based economies, struggle with financial planning due to a lack of access to structured financial insights. Traditional credit scoring models are ineffective for unbanked individuals who rely on mobile money transactions. Neural Cash aims to bridge this gap by providing AI-powered financial behavior analysis and recommendations.

## 💡 Key Features
- **AI-Powered Financial Behavior Analysis**: Uses machine learning to analyze transaction history and detect spending patterns.
- **Personalized Financial Recommendations**: Provides actionable insights to help users manage expenses and improve financial health.
- **Creditworthiness Prediction**: Uses alternative credit scoring based on spending habits instead of traditional bank data.
- **USSD & Mobile App Integration**: Ensures accessibility for users with or without smartphones.
- **Data Security & Privacy**: Ensures financial data is protected using industry-standard encryption techniques.

## 🏗️ Tech Stack
- **Frontend**: React.js (for the web app)
- **Backend**: Node.js with Express.js (API)
- **Database**: Firebase & PostgreSQL
- **AI Model**: TensorFlow & Scikit-Learn for machine learning predictions
- **Mobile Money Integration**: USSD APIs
- **Deployment**: GitHub Pages (Frontend), AWS/GCP (Backend & AI Model)

## 🔧 Installation & Setup
